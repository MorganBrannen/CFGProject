            <h2>Finding excitement in the everyday</h2>
            <p>Throughout the lockdown I have come to love the beauty of my surroundings at home. Previously I had just thought of my hometown as a boring suburb that lacked any natural beauty. However, my time in lockdown has allowed me to explore parts of Falkirk that I had not previously and discover some hidden gems. I have taken a few trips to a local forest, Torwood, exploring the woods there and finding some interesting landmarks. There is a castle from the 16th century, Tappoch Broch, an iron-age stone structure and most intriguingly the Torwood blue pool. This pool is a manmade circular pool filled with bright blue water, it is not clear how deep it is or for what purpose it was built. The most accepted theory is that it was used for old mining or quarry work. These adventures off the beaten track have allowed me to find some exciting local landmarks that are shrouded in mystery. I highly encourage everyone to do some of this at-home exploring, expanding your view of your local area and possibly finding some mysteries at the same time. Not only will getting out into the fresh air help to get you moving and improve your mindset, it can add a bit of excitement to the similarity of lockdown days, especially if you go seeking an adventure. 
               <br>
               <br>
                If you are interested in finding some local natural wonders, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/index.html">Undiscovered Scotland website</a> which contains a wealth of information about some of Scotland's lesser known attractions. Happy exploring!

                <h2>Virtual tours of the world's best scenery</h2>
                <p>Being stuck indoors due to lockdown has really limited our ability to get out and see the world. Even as things are opening up it may be a long time until we can see some fantastic monuments and scenery again. However, this doesn't mean we are completely unable to do this. There are a number of websites and organisations offering virtual tours and experiences to those who want to keep seeing the world from their home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of these is <a href="https://www.cyark.org" >cyArk</a>founded in 2003 to digitally record, archive and share the world's cultural heritage sites and ensure these sites continue to be explored and learned about. This website offers 3D tours of monuments from the Brandenburg Gate to Chichén Itzá. And it is all for free! Take a look for yourself and you might learn some new things you didn't know before whilst seeing some amazing sites. </p>
