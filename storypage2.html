            <h2>Gift-giving Australian dolphins </h2>
            <p>Dolphins are often described as the dogs of the sea. They are friendly, playful and they love interacting with humans. Some dolphins in Australia have proven to be especially fond of their human friends. These dolphins in Queensland have been bringing their human friends gifts from the sea during the coronavirus pandemic. The dolphins have been carrying the gifts such as barnacles, old bottles and pieces of corals on the top of their noses.Â

            <h2>Rehabilitated orangutan has its first wild birth</h2>
            <p> 
                A female orangutan called Susi has given birth to her first baby in the wild after being rescued from a life of captivity. Susi was rescued in 2011 by Indonesian conservation forces. She was found with chains around her neck that had left her very badly injured. After undergoing five years of rehabilitation at the <a href="https://worldanimalnews.com/promising-news-as-rescued-rehabilitated-orangutan-saved-from-a-life-in-chains-gives-birth-to-her-first-baby-in-the-wild/">International Animal Rescue's </a> Orangutan Conservation Centre, Susi was released in 2016. Her new baby, Sinar, was discovered this May by a team from International Animal Rescue who have been monitoring the orangutan since her release four years ago. This is an incredible development as it is the second baby to be born to a rehabilitated orangutan in the Gunung Tarak protected forest. These animals play an important role in protecting the forest's ecosystem and helping to maintain the natural balance, not only benefitting the animals but the local communities.
