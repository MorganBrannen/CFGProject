            <h2>Scientific advancements that are out of this world</h2>
            <p>In a time when much of the world has been stopped in its tracks, science has been racing towards expanding our knowledge and understanding of life beyond our own. There has been two significant scientific explorations of space over the lockdown period. The first being the well-known and documented SpaceX launch of two NASA astronauts into space and to the International Space Station. This was a historic moment in space exploration with SpaceX being the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and the first crewed launch from American soil in 9 years. Headed by Elon Musk, the main aim of these missions is to decrease the cost of space exploration, making it theoretically accessible for almost anyone. It also focuses on using a reusable launch system  successfully doing this by using a single first-stage booster five times in its launches. This is an exciting development in the realm of space exploration and a project that is definitely worth <a href="https://www.spacex.com">researching</a> and keeping an eye on for the future.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second space related development occurred due to the work of scientists at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Nasa and the Lunar Planetary Institute. <a href="https://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/download/Moon/Geology/thumbs/Unified_Geologic_Map_of_The_Moon_200dpi.jpg">The Unified Geological Map of the Moon</a> combines data from the 1960s and 1970s with modern satellite data to compile an image catalogue of stunning geological features. This map will aid future crewed missions to the moon or serve as an educational aid for students on Earth. As new research develop the map will be added to and given even more detail. We highly recommend everyone checks out the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/usgs-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-geologic-map-moon">USGS website</a> and view the animated version of the map. The website further details the process behind making the map and what each part of its colour-code means.

                Whilst life on the ground may not be so inspiring, looking towards the stars is an excellent way to learn something new and take your mind off things. </p>
