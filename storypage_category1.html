            <h2>Delicious mini-egg and white chocolate cheesecake </h2>
            <p>Baking has become one of my favourite things to spend time doing during this lockdown and this cheesecake has quickly become a family favourite. This is the recipe I followed to make this delicious treat.</p>
            <p>
               1. Line the base of a tin with greaseproof paper or a reusable baking liner.<br>
               2. Crush 100g of digestive biscuits.<br>
               3. Melt 40g of butter and mix this with the crushed digestives. Put the biscuit mixture into the prepared tin and put this into the fridge to chill while you make the topping. <br>
               4. Melt 175g of white chocolate and set aside to cool. <br>
                5. Crush 1 and 1/2 bags of Mini Eggs.<br>
                6. Whip 150ml of double cream until it forms a stiff peak.<br>
                7. Add the cooled, melted white chocolate to the whipped cream and whisk together.<br>
                8. Add 250g of cream cheese and 100g of caster sugar into the cream & white chocolate mixture and mix until combined and thick. Fold in the bashed Mini Eggs. <br>
                9. Remove the tin from the fridge and add the cheesecake mixture.<br>
                10. Refrigerate until the cheesecake has set, I left mine overnight. <br>
                11. Decorate with any leftover mini eggs.

            <h2>An easy and customisable meal</h2>
            <p>My family and I have started making our own pizzas as a healthier alternative to ordering takeaway. It's become a family favourite and a great way to make pizzas that are exactly how we want them. <br>
                For the pizza base you can use anything from pre-made pizza bases, pizza dough, wraps or even pitta bread. It's completely up to you! <br>
                We normally use pizza marinara sauce but you can use any tomato sauce that is lying around the house. <br>
                For topping, my favourites are peppers, onions and lots of cheese. Your toppings can include anything you want from pepperoni to pineapple. <br>
                After assembling the pizza, put in the oven for the time instructed for your base or until it becomes crispy and the cheese is melted.
